4.
a)
methods A and B use np.sum on whole sets, which creates a super huge value which will lead to floating point error
method C does not use this and instead does the subtraction as it's summing them up, making use of less massive values, so there's less floating point error
method C is most accurate

b)
any floating point system can instroduce errors when dealing with big enough numbers; as such, it is not a reliable indicator that a crime is being committed.
